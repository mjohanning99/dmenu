# Marvin's build of suckless' dmenu
This is my build of suckless' `dmenu` program. It includes support for pywal, has a different (and bigger!) default font, has the `centre` patched applied and can be easily used with my `dmenu` scripts.

## Installation
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dmenu is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dmenu
(if necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running dmenu
-------------
See the man page for details.
